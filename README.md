# Grid System
Hello! :wave:

This Grid System is based off of my GameJam for my College, I was so annoyed with the Grid Movement that I rewrote it 3 times during the jam, and I wasn't sasified with it.
Because we couldn't make good levels if my coding made the game crash if a movable object was touching a wall, then how can you ship that??

So I have spent like 2 days taking the idea of TileMapLayer and using a Grid based Vector2 map of objects to check collision... instead of Area2D's lol.

I JUST finished the Ice Physics and I'm going to try to remake everything else like the buttons, doors, and boosters.

## You are very welcome to submit PR's to fix my HORRIBLE CODE!!!!
